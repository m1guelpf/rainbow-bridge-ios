# Rainbow Bridge (iOS App)

> An iOS Safari extension that redirects MetaMask calls to Rainbow.

Since I can't figure out how to get (the Rainbow source)[https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow] running locally, here's a super simple iOS app that includes the extension only. Extracting it from here and adding it to the main app shouldn't be too hard.

Licensed under MIT blah blah blah just use it.
